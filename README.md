1. Clone the Basic Carousel repo using following command "git clone https://github.com/roshniv/BasicCarousel.git"
2. Change the directory to BasicCarousel "cd BasicCarousel"
3. install all the dependencies "npm install"
4. build the project "npm run build"
5. open src/client/index.html on any of the browser. 
It will have all changes for the carousel.

Let me know if you see any issues.
